# SerialSniffer

An Arduino-based tool for reverse engineering and decoding serial communication protocols.

## Overview

SerialSniffer is designed to capture, analyze, and decode serial communication between devices. This is useful for:
- Reverse engineering proprietary serial protocols
- Debugging serial communication issues
- Understanding device communication patterns
- Analyzing data transmission formats

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, or compatible)
- Serial communication interface
- Target devices for monitoring

## Features

- Real-time serial data capture
- Hex and ASCII output modes
- Configurable baud rates
- Data logging capabilities

## Getting Started

1. Connect your Arduino to your computer
2. Upload the SerialSniffer sketch
3. Configure serial parameters (baud rate, data bits, parity)
4. Monitor and analyze captured data
